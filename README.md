The scripts above cover solutions to problems from [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/). I highly recommend trying the problems out for fun projects and exercises. This repository is mainly to keep track of my own completed problems for reference.

### Completed:
- [x] P48: Self powers
- [x] P49: Prime permutations
- [x] P50: Consecutive prime sum
- [ ] P51: Prime digit replacements
